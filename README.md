## My inspiration

On the east coast, people have oil tanks in their basements. But people don’t go in their basements that often so if anything happens, then there could be huge consequences like the oil could catch on fire and the repairs could go really high. By the time you find out about the leak, it would cause severe damage.

## How can this problem be solved?

We need to have a device that will be able to detect when a leakage happens from the oil tank and can notify the house owner to take action before the leak causes damage. We need to use a sensor that can be able to smell the difference between the normal air and the air that is contaminaited with the smell from the oil leak.

## My solution

I think that my device, Gas Leak Detector, will be able to solve this problem. In Gas Leak Detector, it is equipped with Seeed’s multichannel gas sensor, a fan, and a Wio Terminal. Using the multichannel gas sensor, it should be able to smell the gas leak in just a few seconds. The fan is a crucial part to this project because it helps circulate the air so that the multichannel gas sensor can get accurate readings.

## Why did you choose to make this project?

I chose to make this project because there might be some people that have no idea how old their oil tank is, and oil tanks can only last 15 to 20 years at a time. If you do not replace your oil tank in that length of time, then there is a high chance that your oil tank will leak. If your oil tank leaks, it can cause health problems, it can catch on fire, and more.

## What did you find difficult while making your project and how did you work it out?

In this project, when I was testing out my design, I realized that my multichannel gas sensor alone was not representing the accurate data. But then when I had added a fan to it, I noticed that the results were more accurate. The reason it was not working was because the air was not circulating so it was not getting the proper data.

## Is there anything you would do differently or you would add if you had more time?

If I had more time, then I would probably add a solar pannel because there are lots of houses that have outdoor oil tanks. If we add solar pannels to it, then it can last long outside. Another thing I would add if I had time would be to collect data for different gas since not all oil tanks have the same gas inside. Like some can have deisle, petrol, and more.
